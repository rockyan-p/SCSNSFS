Complexes in Figure 4A are submitted to the PRODIGY web server: Xue, L. C., Rodrigues, J. P., Kastritis, P. L., Bonvin, A. M. & Vangone, A. PRODIGY: a web server for predicting the binding affinity of protein–protein complexes. Bioinformatics 32, 3676–3678 (2016), and we compare the difference in binding energy between two interfaces, Mtb to Mta, and Mtb to Mtb. If there are no predicted contacts between two protein chains, the binding energy is assumed to be zero. For identical Mtb in same-MT cases, the Mtb interface with the highest affinity to Mta is used as a conservative measure
